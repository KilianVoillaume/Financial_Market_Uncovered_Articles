# 📚 Financial Market Uncovered

A curated series of in-depth educational articles and Python code notebooks exploring key concepts in financial markets — from options and volatility to risk management, swaps, credit, and exotic derivatives.

## 🔍 Overview

**Financial Market Uncovered** is a personal initiative to bridge the gap between theory and practice in finance. Each article in this series explores a specific concept in financial markets — combining accessible explanations, real-world context, and Python-based quantitative implementations.

These articles are crafted for students, analysts, aspiring quants, and anyone curious about how markets function at a deeper level. Some concepts are beginner-friendly, while others assume familiarity with financial math and derivatives. Most pieces are inspired by foundational texts such as Hull, Glasserman, Gatheral, and academic/industry practice.

This repository evolves regularly, with new articles published every 1–2 weeks.

## ✨ Topics Covered

Each entry in the series combines article-style explanations and working Python code to explore a concept such as:

- **📘 Derivatives & Options**
  - [Mastering Options](#) – Basics of call/put mechanics and payoff structures
  - [Black-Scholes Explained](#) – The formula that changed finance
  - [Mastering the Greeks](#) – Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho demystified
  - [Exotic Options](#) – Barrier, Asian, Lookback, and hybrid derivatives

- **🌪 Volatility & Risk**
  - [Decoding Volatility](#) – Historical, realized, and implied vol with smiles/skews
  - [Forecasting Volatility](#) – From EWMA and GARCH to stochastic models
  - [Risk Measurement](#) – Monte Carlo simulation for VaR & CVaR

- **💳 Credit & Swaps**
  - [Credit Risk Unveiled](#) – Default models, CDS, tranches, correlation risk
  - [Swaps & Structured Derivatives](#) – IRS, TRS, and product engineering

- **... and more...**

Each article is backed by Python code to illustrate:
- Simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo, volatility paths)
- Analytical models (e.g., Black-Scholes, Greeks)
- Graphical visualisations (e.g., payoff diagrams, risk surfaces)

📊 Educational Philosophy
Each article aims to:
- Introduce a real-world concept with clear motivation
- Explain the quantitative mechanics behind it
- Provide working code to reinforce the math
- Offer market context and application examples
- Articles blend accessibility and technical depth — assuming no prior expertise, but gradually advancing into practitioner-level understanding.
